    <img src="../images/chocereals.webp" alt="Picture of Chocolate Cereal Bars">
    <p>Chocolate cereal bars are a type of snack that typically consist of a mixture 
      of chocolate, cereal, and other ingredients such as nuts, dried fruit, or marshmallows. 
      The ingredients are melted and combined, then pressed into a bar shape and cooled to solidify. 
      They are a convenient and portable snack that is often marketed as a healthier alternative to 
      traditional candy bars, and are popular with both children and adults.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats</li>
      <li>1 cup puffed brown rice cereal</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped raw almonds</li>
      <li>1/3 cup shredded coconut</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup maple syrup</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedures</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 pan with butter and line with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Combine rolled oats, puffed brown rice cereal, almonds, coconut, cocoa powder, salt, and cayenne in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over
         medium-high heat. Stir, and let the mixture boil for 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour sugar mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared pan, and 
        smooth out the top, pressing lightly with a spatula.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. While still hot, use a spatula to score the pan into 8 portions. 
        Let cool to room temperature before breaking into bars. You can also not score, and simply let cool, then cut 
        with a knife.</li>
