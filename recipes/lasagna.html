    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layered sheets of wide flat pasta, 
      tomato-based sauce, meat or vegetables, and cheese. The layers are typically 
      repeated several times, with the final layer topped with a generous amount of 
      cheese that becomes golden and crispy when baked in the oven. It is a popular 
      and comforting meal that is often served at family gatherings and special occasions.</p>
